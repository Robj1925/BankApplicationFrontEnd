/* 7) Write a query that displays employees who have had different jobs. Show
      employee number, first and last name, previous job id, previous 
      job start date and end date. Use appropriate column aliases to clarify 
      the results. Order the result by employee id and end date. */
      
  
      
/* 8) Find the first and last names and hire dates of all employees who were

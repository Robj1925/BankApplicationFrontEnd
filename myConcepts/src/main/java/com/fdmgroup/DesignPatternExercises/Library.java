3. Create a library which contains a small number of books. 
A typical situation here may be that there are three books of one title and four of another. 
They can be borrowed and then returned. 
The program must check if the book is available. 
If not, the user must be warned that this is the case. 
When a library user borrows a book, the program should display what books are out on loan and which books are available.  */
